Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install mvstats, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install mvstats

This is the preferred method to install mvstats, as it will always install the most recent stable release. 

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/


From sources (NOTE: At the moment, only this method works)
------------

The sources for mvstats can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/hrishikeshac/mvstats

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/hrishikeshac/mvstats/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/hrishikeshac/mvstats
.. _tarball: https://github.com/hrishikeshac/mvstats/tarball/master
